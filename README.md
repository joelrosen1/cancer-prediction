# MLP and CNN for Cancer Prediction
In this project we:
- Created a MLP with 5 hidden layers to predict lung cancer likelihood based off a dataset 5,000 records with 18 features related to lung cancer risk factors
- Created a CNN to detect what type of skin cancer is in an image using the HAM10000 dataset


## MLP Visualization Application
To run our application:
1. Open `MLP/Cancer_Application.R` in R Studio
2. Click `Run App` with the green arrow next to it on the top right
3. In ~5 minutes the application will open on localhost
